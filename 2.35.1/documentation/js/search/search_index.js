Angular\n    \n    An Angular implementation of the Carbon Design System\n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nGetting started\nAssuming we're starting with a new @angular/cli project:\n$ npx @angular/cli new my-project --style=scss\n$ cd my-project\n$ npm i --save carbon-components-angular carbon-componentsThen we need to include carbon-components in src/styles.scss:\n@import \"~carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/styles.scss\";\nNote: For offline usage we'll need to set $font-path: '~carbon-components/src/globals/fonts'; at the very top of our src/styles.scss. This will copy the fonts to our dist folder upon successful build. If you like the fonts to be a part of your assets folder and not pollute the dist folder then copy the fonts from node_modules/carbon-components/src/globals/fonts into our app's src/assets/fonts folder and add $font-path: '/assets/fonts/'; at the very top of our src/styles.scss.\n\nThat's it! Now we can run npm start and start building out our application!\n\nNote: This isn't the only way to bootstrap a carbon-components-angular application, but the combination of @angular/cli and the carbon-components scss is our recommended setup.\n\n\nContributing\nQuickstart\n\nfork IBM/carbon-components-angular and clone it locally\nrun npm install to grab all the dependencies, then npm run storybook to start storybook\nif you are adding a component:\nadd a folder with your component code, styles, tests and story under src\nexport your module from index.ts\n\n\nif you are contributing a fix:\nadd your fix, update the documentation as needed\nconsider adding or modifying a test case to cover the fix\n\n\nfollow the Angular style guide\nbe sure to run npm test and npm run lint to make sure the tests and linter pass\nsubmit a PR\n\nPull request guidelines\n\nKeep changes small and focused.\nIf you create a pull request and then realize it is not ready to be merged, prepend \"WIP: \" (For example,  WIP: Fixed text overflow in accordion headers.) and assign a WIP label.\nInclude a description of changes\nattach a screenshot (or a gif!) for design reference if needed\nreference the related issue\n\"closes #123\" or \"fixes #123\" will close issue #123 once the PR is merged\n\"issue #123\" just references the issue. Only use this if you definitely need the issue to remain open.\n\n\n@mention any specific other developers that need to be aware of the changes\n\n\nadd the \"needs review\" label along with any other relevant labels\nlink to code review checklist goes here\n\nIssues submission guidelines\n\nOne issue per defect - do not open an issue that spans multiple defects\nprovide a descriptive title that mentions the component and version the issue covers\nprovide\nversion(s) affected\na description of the issue\nsteps taken to produce the issue\nexpected behaviour\ncurrent behaviour\nscreenshots if needed\nrelevant code snippets\nlinks to application source code or running demo (Codesandbox is awesome for this!) (including connection/authentication information)\n\n\nadd relevant labels (bug, accessibility, design, discussion, feature, etc)\nif you have a fix to contribute, assign yourself, otherwise leave unassigned\n\nnpm commands\nTo keep our build dependencies local we use npm scripts to run our webpack, gulp, and general build tasks. You should never install webpack or gulp globally as that will likely conflict with our version.
