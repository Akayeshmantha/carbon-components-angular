Description\n    \n    \n        The Tab component is a child of the Tabs component.\nIt represents one Tab item and its content within a panel of other Tab items.\nTab takes a string or TemplateRef for the header, and any content for the body of the tab.\nDisabled states should be handled by the application (ie. switch to the tab, but display some\nindication as to why the tab is disabled).\nWhen the tab is selected the select output will be triggered.\nThe select output will also be triggered for the active tab when the tabs are loaded or updated.\nTab with string header:\n* \n*     tab 1 content\n* \n*Tab with custom header:\n* \n*     \n*     \n*     Hello Tab 1\n* \n* \n*     \n*         Tab 1 content \n*     \n*     \n*         Tab 2 content\n*     \n*     \n*

   \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nGetting started\nAssuming we're starting with a new @angular/cli project:\n$ npx @angular/cli new my-project --style=scss\n$ cd my-project\n$ npm i --save carbon-components-angular carbon-componentsThen we need to include carbon-components in src/styles.scss:\n@import \"~carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/styles.scss\";\nNote: For offline usage we'll need to set $font-path: '~carbon-components/src/globals/fonts'; at the very top of our src/styles.scss. This will copy the fonts to our dist folder upon successful build. If you like the fonts to be a part of your assets folder and not pollute the dist folder then copy the fonts from node_modules/carbon-components/src/globals/fonts into our app's src/assets/fonts folder and add $font-path: '/assets/fonts/'; at the very top of our src/styles.scss.\n\nThat's it! Now we can run npm start and start building out our application!\n\nNote: This isn't the only way to bootstrap a carbon-components-angular application, but the combination of @angular/cli and the carbon-components scss is our recommended setup.\n\n\nContributing\nQuickstart\n\nfork IBM/carbon-components-angular and clone it locally\nrun npm install to grab all the dependencies, then npm run storybook to start storybook\nif you are adding a component:\nadd a folder with your component code, styles, tests and story under src\nexport your module from index.ts\n\n\nif you are contributing a fix:\nadd your fix, update the documentation as needed\nconsider adding or modifying a test case to cover the fix\n\n\nfollow the Angular style guide\nbe sure to run npm test and npm run lint to make sure the tests and linter pass\nsubmit a PR\n\nPull request guidelines\n\nKeep changes small and focused.\nIf you create a pull request and then realize it is not ready to be merged, prepend \"WIP: \" (For example,  WIP: Fixed text overflow in accordion headers.) and assign a WIP label.\nInclude a description of changes\nattach a screenshot (or a gif!) for design reference if needed\nreference the related issue\n\"closes #123\" or \"fixes #123\" will close issue #123 once the PR is merged\n\"issue #123\" just references the issue. Only use this if you definitely need the issue to remain open.\n\n\n@mention any specific other developers that need to be aware of the changes\n\n\nadd the \"needs review\" label along with any other relevant labels\nlink to code review checklist goes here\n\nIssues submission guidelines\n\nOne issue per defect - do not open an issue that spans multiple defects\nprovide a descriptive title that mentions the component and version the issue covers\nprovide\nversion(s) affected\na description of the issue\nsteps taken to produce the issue\nexpected behaviour\ncurrent behaviour\nscreenshots if needed\nrelevant code snippets\nlinks to application source code or running demo (Codesandbox is awesome for this!) (including connection/authentication information)\n\n\nadd relevant labels (bug, accessibility, design, discussion, feature, etc)\nif you have a fix to contribute, assign yourself, otherwise leave unassigned\n\nnpm commands\nTo keep our build dependencies local we use npm scripts to run our webpack, gulp, and general build tasks. You should never install webpack or gulp globally as that will likely conflict with our version. You should never need to modify the build process to add a component or story.\n\nnpm run storybook to run storybook (port 6006)\nnpm run build to generate the dist\ndocs:build to build documentation\ndocs:server to build and run the documentation server\nnpm run lint to run tslint\nnpm test to run tests\n\nResources\n\nStyle guide (WIP)\nGeneral component API guidelines (WIP)\nAngular style guide\nI18N tooling\nI18N guide\nngx-translate\n\n\n(Angular 2+ doesn't have anything like ngAria, instead here's The A11Y Project, WAI-ARIA specs, and WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices)\nTypeScript docs\n\nPhilosophy\n\nComponents should be the smallest unit of computation\nThink in terms of pages and applications composed from a multitude of components rather than pages or applications as a single unit of computation\n\n\nComponents should delegate to the consumer whenever possible\nThe individual applications should be the single source of truth, and be able to create any UI from our building blocks\n\n\nComponents should do one thing, and do it well\nThis does not mean they should be over specialized, but rather focus on providing a single, core experience\n\n\nComponents should NOT maintain more state than absolutely necessary\nLikewise, stateless components should be favored whenever possible\n\n\nComponents should NOT necessarily implement the style guide point-for-point, the guide simply provides guidance on overarching functionality, components should enable that and product specific designs without baking in extra functionality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\n                             Apache License\n                       Version 2.0, January 2004\n                    http://www.apache.org/licenses/   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\nDefinitions.\n\"License\" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,\nand distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.\n\"Licensor\" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by\nthe copyright owner that is granting the License.\n\"Legal Entity\" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all\nother entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common\ncontrol with that entity.
